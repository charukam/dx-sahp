Univeristy of Calgary Capstone Project creating a full scale heat pump cycle with a novel solar collector to heat a domestic hot water tank.

### MATLAB Code
_CoolProp_ (a C++ library) is required to run the MATLAB code to calculate system states for different refrigerants: http://www.coolprop.org/

### SOLIDWORKS Model
SOLIDWORKS 2020 is required for the SLDPRT and SLDASM files
