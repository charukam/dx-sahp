%% Executive Summary
\chapter{Executive Summary}
This report will explore the research, calculations, and engineering design as the preliminary work required before constructing a Direct Expansion Solar Assisted Heat Pump. These systems combine the benefits of solar energy and heat pump technology to provide hot water for domestic use with high efficiencies. With Calgary being the sunniest city in Canada \cite{calgary_sun}, there is a vast under-utilization of solar energy. This report outlines a heat pump design that utilizes solar energy to heat water for residential use. A parametric study was performed to determine the optimum solar collector configuration. Subsequently, a component matching study was conducted to find compatible compressor, condenser, and expansion valve components. The results from these studies are presented in this report with plans for producing a working model next semester.
