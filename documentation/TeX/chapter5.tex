\section{Use of Project Resources and Contact Hours}
For this project, biweekly meetings with the sponsor and meetings with the faculty advisor were scheduled as needed. The team also met with advisors from Klass Mechanical for advice on a regular basis as well.

\section{Cost Overview}
A budget of \$10,000 was provided to the team to construct the prototype. The team had to be conscious of how much each component costs to remain under budget. Figure () shows a brief cost breakdown of the components that comprises the prototype.
