    \item Kerwin oversees the Project Management of the group which is to ensure that everything is going according to plan and to assist in contacting vendors and setting schedules up. 
    \item Nadia is responsible for the designing and sizing the collector. She is in charge of ensuring that the collector is functional.
    \item Jessica oversees component matching. Her role is important since without her, components may not work together.
    \item Charuka is the assembly lead. When the parts have arrived, he will be the one in the shop piecing it all together and leading us in that part of the project.
    \item Dhruvi will look directly into the control and data acquisition system. These include looking into all the flow meters, thermistors, and pressure transducers to list a few. Itâ€™s essential to have these components for testing purposes.
    \item Edwin will be the testing lead when the prototype has been finished. He will oversee collecting all the data that would be needed to support our project.
